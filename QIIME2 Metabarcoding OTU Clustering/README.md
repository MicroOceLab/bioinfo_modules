# QIIME2 Metabarcoding OTU Clustering Module

OTU clustering refers to the process of grouping together sequences via some similarity threshold into clusters called operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Here, we explore the common workflow used to perform OTU clustering of metabarcoding data in QIIME2.

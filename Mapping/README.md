# Mapping Module

In this module, we learn how to use BBMap as a general-purpose utility to map clean reads to a reference assembly. Moreoever, we also explore a wrapper script available in the Trinity package (`align_and_estimate_abundance.pl`). This script aligns reads to a Trinity RNA-seq assembly, and subsequently, estimates the abundance of the assembled transcripts.

# Contig-Level Taxonomic Annotation Module

Taxonomic annotation of assembled NGS data (i.e. contigs) is covered in this module. This includes tools that are used to classify contigs to different taxonomic domains (e.g. using VirSorter2, EukRep, etc). Other annotation tools that are able to assign more specific taxonomic identities and are reference-based are also included (e.g. MMSeqs2). Lastly, we also include Bin Annotation Tool (BAT) which is used to assign a putative identity to a metagenome-assembled genome.

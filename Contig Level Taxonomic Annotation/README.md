# Contig-Level Taxonomic Annotation Module

Taxonomic annotation of assembled NGS data (i.e. contigs) is covered in this module. This includes tools that are used to identify the taxonomic domain of contigs (e.g. using VirSorter2, EukRep, etc). Other annotation tools that are able to assign more specific taxonomic identities and are reference-based are also included (e.g. MMSeqs2).

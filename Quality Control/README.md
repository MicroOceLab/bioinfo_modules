# Quality Control Module

Quality control is a crucial step in working with sequencing data since it ensures that low-quality, inaccurate, and irrelevant information are removed from the dataset. We explore in this module common ways to assess quality of sequencing data (e.g. FastQC, MultiQC), and approaches used to filter and trim reads.

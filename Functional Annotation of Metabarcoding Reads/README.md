Although functional information is inherently unavailable from metabarocding data, PICRUSt2 offers a methodology to infer functions from 16S data by searching genome databases. Here, we explore step-by-step how to use the PICRUSt2 pipeline to generate gene counts table from 16S sequences and OTU/ASV tables.

# Contig Binning Module

This module focuses on contig binning (i.e. grouping of contigs into bins based on their characteristics) using MetaBAT2. It also includes different tools to assess bin quality (using completeness and contamination measures) tailored for different source organisms (CheckM for prokaryotes, CheckV for viruses, and EukCC for eukaryotes).

# QIIME2 Marker Gene Taxonomic Classification Module

After preprocessing of metabarcoding data, to make biological sense of the data, we need to attach taxonomic information to the feature (OTUs/ASVs) sequences. Here, we learn how to taxonomically annotate the feature sequences in QIIME2 using a pre-trained Naive-Bayes classifier.

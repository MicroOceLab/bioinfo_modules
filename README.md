# Bioinformatics Module Documentation Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for bioinformatics pipelines, structured as a collection of modular Jupyter notebooks, codes, and/or scripts. Each module represents a self-contained section of a larger pipeline, providing a step-by-step guide for specific bioinformatics tasks. These modules are designed to aid researchers and students in building their own custom workflows that fit their research goals.

## Repository Features

* **Modular Structure**: Each notebook addresses a single aspect of bioinformatics workflows, such as data preprocessing, quality control, functional annotation, and more.
* **Reusability**: Modules are designed to be mixed and matched, providing flexibility to users who may want to integrate selected sections into their existing workflows.
* **Interactive Code** (mostly): Most modules are written in Jupyter and RMarkdown, allowing users to directly run code blocks, explore outputs, and make adjustments based on their data.
* **Report Generation**: Easily generate reproducible reports using Jupyter notebooks and RMarkdown, facilitating the presentation of methods, code, and results. This feature streamlines project documentation and provides clear outputs that are easily shared with collaborators.
